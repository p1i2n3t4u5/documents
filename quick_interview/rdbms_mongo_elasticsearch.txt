Relational databases, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch are different types of databases, each suited for different use cases. Hereâ€™s a comparison of the three:

1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)
Example Systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server
Data Model: Relational (tables with rows and columns)
Schema: Fixed schema (predefined structure for tables with strict column types)
Data Integrity: Strong ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties ensure data integrity and reliability.
Query Language: SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for data manipulation.
Use Cases: Best for transactional applications, structured data, complex relationships (foreign keys), and when data integrity is crucial (e.g., banking, inventory systems).
Scalability: Vertical scaling (scale-up by increasing resources on a single server); horizontal scaling is possible but complex.
Indexing: Supports primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes for efficient query execution.
Pros:

Strong consistency and data integrity.
Established technology with mature tools.
Suitable for complex queries and joins.
Cons:

Fixed schema makes it harder to handle unstructured or rapidly changing data.
Vertical scalability can be limiting for large-scale applications.
2. MongoDB (NoSQL, Document-Oriented Database)
Data Model: Document-based (stores data in BSON format, which is similar to JSON)
Schema: Flexible schema (schema-less or dynamic schema; documents can have different structures)
Data Integrity: BASE model (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency); weaker consistency guarantees than ACID.
Query Language: MongoDB Query Language (MQL), which is JSON-like.
Use Cases: Suitable for applications with unstructured or semi-structured data, rapidly changing schemas, and large-scale data (e.g., content management, IoT, social networks).
Scalability: Horizontal scaling (sharding) is natively supported, which makes it better suited for distributed systems and large datasets.
Indexing: Supports secondary indexes, geospatial indexes, and full-text indexes.
Pros:

Flexible schema allows for easy data model changes.
Easy to scale horizontally.
Great for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
Cons:

Weaker consistency compared to relational databases.
Lacks native support for complex relationships and joins (workarounds are needed).
Not ideal for applications with strong data consistency requirements.
3. Elasticsearch (Search Engine, Distributed Search Database)
Data Model: Document-based (stores data as JSON documents, optimized for search and analytics)
Schema: Flexible schema, but mappings can be defined for fields to optimize indexing and searching.
Data Integrity: BASE model (eventual consistency); optimized for high availability and search speed.
Query Language: Elasticsearch Query DSL (Domain-Specific Language), designed for full-text search.
Use Cases: Best for full-text search, log and event data analysis, real-time search, and analytics (e.g., e-commerce search, log aggregation, business intelligence dashboards).
Scalability: Highly scalable horizontally (built for distributed architecture), supports sharding and replication out of the box.
Indexing: Optimized for full-text search, supports custom analyzers and tokenizers for indexing text data.
Pros:

Extremely fast and powerful full-text search capabilities.
Designed for distributed architecture, making it scalable for large datasets.
Flexible schema and document-based storage.
Cons:

Not ideal for transactional data and strong consistency.
Weaker support for ACID transactions.
Limited capabilities for complex joins or relational queries.
Summary Comparison Table:
Feature	Relational Database	MongoDB	Elasticsearch
Data Model	Relational (tables)	Document-based (BSON/JSON)	Document-based (JSON)
Schema	Fixed schema	Flexible schema	Flexible schema
Query Language	SQL	MQL (MongoDB Query Language)	Query DSL
Consistency	ACID	Eventual consistency (BASE)	Eventual consistency (BASE)
Scalability	Vertical, limited horizontal	Horizontal (sharding)	Horizontal (distributed by design)
Use Cases	Transactional apps, structured data	Unstructured data, big data	Full-text search, analytics
Strengths	Data integrity, complex queries	Flexibility, scaling	Speed, full-text search
Weaknesses	Harder to scale, rigid schema	Weaker consistency, no joins	Not for transactional workloads
Each technology is optimized for different use cases. Relational databases are best for structured and transactional data, MongoDB is great for flexibility and scaling with unstructured data, and Elasticsearch excels at full-text search and analytics.
