SSL Termination (also known as TLS Termination) refers to the process of decrypting encrypted SSL/TLS traffic at a specific point in a network, typically at a load balancer or reverse proxy server, before it is forwarded to a web server.

How SSL Termination Works:
Incoming Traffic Encryption:

Clients (like web browsers) establish an HTTPS connection to a server, encrypting the data being transmitted using SSL/TLS.
SSL/TLS Decryption:

The SSL/TLS-encrypted traffic reaches the load balancer, reverse proxy, or a dedicated SSL terminator, where the encryption is terminated (i.e., the data is decrypted).
This means that the SSL/TLS session between the client and the server ends at this point.
Forwarding Plain Traffic:

Once the traffic is decrypted, it is forwarded to the backend servers as plain HTTP traffic.
The backend servers don't need to deal with the overhead of decrypting SSL/TLS themselves, allowing them to focus on processing the actual requests.
Response Encryption (if applicable):

The process can also work in reverse for outgoing responses: the plain HTTP response from the server is re-encrypted by the SSL terminator before being sent back to the client over HTTPS.
Benefits of SSL Termination:
Performance: Offloading SSL/TLS decryption to a dedicated device (like a load balancer) reduces the computational overhead on application servers, improving their performance.
Simplified Certificate Management: SSL certificates need to be managed only at the point of termination (e.g., the load balancer), not on every individual server.
Load Balancing: SSL termination at the load balancer allows the load balancer to distribute traffic efficiently based on content inspection, as the traffic is decrypted.
Security Monitoring: It enables more straightforward inspection and logging of traffic, as it is decrypted before reaching the internal servers.
Considerations:
Security Concerns: Since traffic is decrypted at the SSL termination point, it traverses the internal network as plain HTTP. This might expose sensitive data if the internal network is not secure.
Re-encryption: In some setups, SSL/TLS might be terminated and then re-established with the backend servers to maintain end-to-end encryption. This is known as SSL Bridging.
Typical Use Cases:
Load Balancers: Often used in load balancers to offload SSL processing from application servers.
Reverse Proxies: Common in reverse proxies that sit between users and a web server, allowing for traffic management and SSL offloading.
Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): CDNs may terminate SSL to optimize the delivery of content by caching responses closer to the user.
In summary, SSL termination is a technique used to optimize and manage encrypted traffic in a network by offloading the decryption process from the application servers to a dedicated point, improving performance and simplifying SSL certificate management.
